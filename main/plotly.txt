3. Ensuring Appropriate Level of Abstraction

Each ILH concept has been carefully placed within the CCO hierarchy to match its level of abstraction:

    High-Level Concepts: Such as Policy and Information Protection are placed under broad categories like Directive Information Content Entity and Function, reflecting their overarching roles.
    Specific Concepts: Like ILH Handling Rule and Policy Authority are nested under more specific classes, indicating their specialized nature within the ILH domain.
    Processes and Acts: Activities like Data Classification and Information Labeling are categorized under Planned Act, emphasizing their procedural characteristics.
    Roles and Agents: Policy Authority is placed under Authority Role, linking the role to agents responsible for policy enforcement.

4. Summary of the Integrated ILH Ontology within CCO

By aligning the ILH concepts with the CCO hierarchy, we achieve:

    Consistency: Ensuring ILH concepts are integrated without conflicting with existing CCO classes.
    Clarity: Providing clear definitions that distinguish each concept.
    Usability: Facilitating the use of ILH concepts within the broader context of the CCO for applications in data classification and handling.

Final Notes

This integration allows users and systems to:

    Understand the relationships between ILH concepts and standard ontological categories.
    Leverage existing CCO structures to enhance interoperability and data sharing.
    Apply the ILH ontology effectively within their organizational frameworks while maintaining alignment with common ontology practices.
